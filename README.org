* About

This egg contains wrapper for Chipmunk2D. Though it is usable in itself, its main purpose is to serve as a foundation for chicken-physics, which is a more high-level library that lifts the strengths of Scheme.

* Installation

This egg comes with Chipmunk 6.2.1 built-in. Simply clone this repository and run =chicken-install= inside the project's root directory.

* Todo

- Unit tests
- Setters for cpContactPointSet (I'm looking for a clean way of doing this)

For the rest, everything mentioned in [[http://chipmunk-physics.net/release/ChipmunkLatest-Docs/]Chipmunk's manual] is covered.
